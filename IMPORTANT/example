(TEST ALERT FOR EAS_GENERATOR)

FORMAT:
Line 1 is the Header of the alert
Line 2 is the Issuer of the alert
Linee 3-4 make up the alert itself, Line 3 indicates the hazard and line 4 indicates the alert type (warning/ watch/ advisory)
Line 5 counts the number of lines the code reads for the locations. DO NOT NEGLECT THIS LINE OR ELSE THE SCROLLING WILL NOT WORK!!!!
After Line 5, you can add all of the counties/ areas where the hazard is affecting. Add as many lines as you have set up in Line 5. Otherwise, the scrolling may read the rest of the program incorrectly.
After you add the counties and areas, the last three lines should follow this:
- Expiration of the alert (mm/dd/yyyy hh:hh:ss TMZ)
- Station ID or Programming ID relaying the Emergency Broadcast
- Add a sound filepath for the alert to play thorugh (haven't played through that though, would like some assistance on that would be noice

The program will stop reading after the sound file-ish, so you can write as much notes and shit if you want to add context to the files you make in your alerts.
