# **EAS-Java-Generator**
Basic prototype for creating EAS Screens automatically using Java. Feel free to add your own bells and whistles on your own downloads!


# IMPORTANT
- This program will search for a specific font file "VCR EAS.ttf" that you will need to add to your laptop in order to have the full enhancement of the program. If you do not have this font added to your font list, the program will try to find the default font for your Java workspace.
- Be sure to look at the example in the folder for how you should format your plain text files so the program can read the file and output the file correctly!
- This code is free to use. No need ask for special permission, just do it!
- I've added some comments in the code to make it easier to customize the GUI of the program, such as the background and text color, and scrolling speed.
